<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Unity application was developed to help students in the IT Lab premises at the WISO of the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg.
The app offers students the possibility to get a live navigation to different devices in the premises through AR. Through an admin panel, new destinations can be added and removed, which are then synchronized with a server to always ensure the most up-to-date status between all users. Through a QR scanner integrated into the app, the player can be reset to the starting point for ease of use.
